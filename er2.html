    Some people make money by sitting in offices all day. Other people take a risky and controversial path of becoming a social media influencer. Becoming a social media influencer takes a lot of work and not everyone is able to succeed in the field. However, those who do excel in this area of work still struggle to make money. Youtubers specifically make money from ads put on their videos by Youtube Headquarters. Speculation has gone around as to how ads are put on videos and the logic behind Youtube's recent changes.

      Logan Paul has been on Youtube since August 29, 2015 and has blown up faster than other Youtubers have in the past. However, a recent scandal has caused him to lose subscribers and cause havoc among the Youtube community. On a trip to Japan, Paul decided to do a 24 hour overnight challenge in a forest where people go to take their lives. Somewhere on his journey through the forest, he saw a dead body hanging from a tree and continued to film it for his audience. He took the opportunity to speak about suicide prevention and how suicide should never have to be a choice you consider. As soon as he posted his video, he received negative backlash. His former fans were angry that he would record a dead body and invade their story when he did not know what had led them to take their life. Paul took down the video and made an apology to the public about how his intentions were pure and he just wanted to make sure people were aware of the help they could get. Viewers of the video were furious that it was not taken down by Youtube who claimed that they "prevent potentially inappropriate videos from monetizing". After inspecting the process that bots go through to take away monetization from certain videos, it was concluded that despite the method used to filter content, videos like Paul's will still remain and make money because he did not say anything explicitly that would cause the bots to respond negatively.

  Shane Dawson is another Youtuber who has been on Youtube since September 21, 2005 and has almost 15 million subscribers. Dawson is known for posting raw and controversial content to his channel and even getting into some serious scandals along the way. In an interview about ads and making money off of ads with Forbes Magazine in 2017, Dawson said "My stuff was so raunchy, that I wasn't getting many ads. I was making a couple grand a month. But it was enough to pay for an apartment. I started making more and eventually my Mom quit her job and started helping me with sketches". This goes to show how dependent Youtubers and other social media influencers are on advertisements which means that if not all of them are 'brand-friendly', they won't be able to financially support themselves. Another way that they can make money is through brand deals. Brand deals are when brands reach out to Youtubers on their own rather than through Youtube itself. Apps such as Best Fiends, Quid, and Honey have sponsored Dawson and supported him throughout bigger video projects which boosted his channel for better. On the other hand, smaller channels than Dawson's don't get sponsorships often and even not at all so they have to rely on Youtube to place ads on their content. This causes a huge disconnect because without the support, people are unemployed with nowhere to go and no income to collect.

  Overall, many believe that Youtube is simply scamming creators and trying to only allow certain content to be 'acceptable'. Once they stop letting videos that talk about mental health, sexual education and have curses make money, Youtubers stop creating that content and Youtube ultimately becomes a clean and innocent place. Personally, I like hearing about other people's lives and not letting them make money off of content they enjoy is extremely limiting to creativity and can cause them to lose supporters. There are many people who have lost supporters because the content they posted was drastically different from what they usually posted and less relatable. Once your strip Youtubers from their freedom of speech, the community becomes disinteresting because everyone sounds exactly the same and does the same type of video.
