    	As time goes on, technology continues to become more and more advanced, slowly gaining new capabilities. While it is really cool to see what we can do to manipulate technology, at the same time, we are replacing ourselves with robots that can not only do the same jobs as us, but more efficiently as well.

    Many people marvel at the incredible things robots can do for us but many also fail to realize that it comes with consequences. CGP Grey, a Youtube channel, made a video entitled, "Humans Need Not Apply” in which they discuss how robot and machines are starting to take over our world. One example given about how jobs are slowly being more robot based is when they explain how "paper work, decision making, writing -- a lot of human work falls into that category and the demand for human mental labor in these areas are way down". Jobs such as lawyers are put at stake because the bots can do the same amount of paperwork that a human can in less time, for less money and with less errors. While this is beneficial to client, it puts a lot of people out of work. Another example of how robots are causing people to lose their jobs is in the automotive field. The more expected takeover is for the technician who’s job can be done better and faster by a few robots. Assembling cars and fixing them is easier than ever before with the new technology in robots. In an article titled "What jobs are being taken over by robots and computers?" posted by ComputerHope.com, it brought up an unexpected loser in this situation: taxi drivers. The tesla model x is a self driving car that can do everything by itself. By putting the car into autopilot, it will drive towards your destination safely and without you having to push the gas or turn the wheel. This allows you to do things you normally would not be able to do by while driving such as eating, talking on the phone or checking your phone. This is convenient for most drivers who are on their way to work or school because they can finish up some last minute work on their assignment on their travels. Due to the ease and good investment this car is, people will be less likely to pay for taxis because they can simply drive themselves around effortlessly and for free everyday.

  In conclusion, while we celebrate the great things that technology does for us, we must also acknowledge the downfalls and consequences of supporting them including unemployment. Unemployment brings less money home to families and therefore will bring the poverty rate lower: all because we want things done a little but faster,
