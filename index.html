<h2> When I Grow Up... </h2>
<ul>
 <p> When I'm older, I want to stay in NYC because I can't imagine leaving a place I've called home for so long permanantly. I would, however, like to go to California. I really enjoy photography and California, especially San Fran and LA, have really good spots for taking pictures. As I get older, I want to continue writing poetry as well, perhaps prefessionally.
